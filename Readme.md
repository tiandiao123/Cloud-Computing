## part I of my cloud-computing projects

### Introduction of the project 1 (more details are shown in the pdf file of the map1 fold): 
This MP (Machine Programming project) is about implementing a membership protocol. Since it is infeasible to run a thousand cluster nodes (peers) over a real network, we are providing you with an implementation of an emulated network layer (EmulNet). Our membership protocol implementation will sit above EmulNet in a peer- to-peer (P2P) layer, but below an App layer. Think of this like a three layer protocol stack with Application, P2P, and EmulNet as the three layers (from top to bottom).
